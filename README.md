## Features

We've created this admin panel for everyone who wants to create templates based on our pre-made components. Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly, clear and easy administration panel that can be used by both simple websites and sophisticated systems. The only requirement is basic HTML and CSS (and some [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki)) knowledge — as a reward, you'll be able to manage and visualize different types of data in the easiest possible way!

* **Responsive:** With the support for mobile, tablet and desktop displays, it doesn’t matter what device you’re using. Tabler is responsive in all major browsers.
* **Cross Browser:** Our theme works perfectly with the latest Chrome, Firefox+, latest Safari, Opera, Edge and mobile browsers. We work hard to to provide continuous support for them.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** We use only modern web technologies, such as HTML5 and CSS3. Our theme includes some subtle CSS3 animations, which will help you attract attention.
* **Clean Code:** We followed Bootstrap’s guidelines carefully to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten and W3C valid.
* **Demo pages**: Tabler features over 20 individual pages using various components, which gives you the freedom to choose and combine. All components can vary in color and styling that you can easily modify using Sass. Sky is the limit!
* **Single Page Application versions:** [Tabler React](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react) has React components for Tabler.

## Getting Started

To run this app locally, you'll first need a copy of Tabler's source files. Clone this repo and follow the steps below:

**General**:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies. We recommend using a version manager like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js.
2. Navigate to the root `/tabler` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) - the recommended version is [2.7.6](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.7/ruby-2.7.6.tar.gz).
4. [Install Bundler](https://bundler.io) with `gem install bundler` and finally run `bundle install`. It will install all Ruby dependencies, including [Jekyll and plugins](https://jekyllrb.com).

**MacOS users**:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. Enter the project directory and install local dependencies via NPM.

```shell
npm install
```

2. For security and ease of installation, avoid the pre-installed version of Ruby that comes with macOS. Use a version manager such as [rbenv](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/ruby_mac/), or [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).

- You can also install Ruby via Homebrew. The recommended Ruby version is 2.7.*

```shell
brew install ruby @2.7
```

- Don't forget to [apply ruby to your shell path](https://replayable.io/replay/62febe988c7631006765f9f3/?share=0loEq8x5fw5qeJyP9ALO8A) and restart the terminal.

- Let's first do a [sanity check](https://replayable.io/replay/62feb54a8c7631006765f9f1/?share=jyhehNWV0geoVtfcx1fbzQ)!

```shell
which ruby
```

- If you see `/usr/bin/ruby` when you use the which command, then the initial installation has failed. It is the pre-installed macOS system Ruby.

3. Install the bundler gem.

```shell
gem install bundler
```

4. Install project gem dependencies via bundler.

```shell
bundle install
```

5. Finally, launch the app.

```shell
npm run start
```

- Enter `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and [everything should work!](https://replayable.io/share/AlgdZGgYZooiVTbtoHg)

**Windows users**:

1. [Install Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/win). And take note of the installation directory. By default it's `C:\Program Files\Git`.

2. Install [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3. By default, NPM is set to CMD. [Configure NPM to use bash](https://replayable.io/replay/6301bdb7c417160066fb88e3/?share=jKEugkJ23Fe3dANIt2s8nA) which comes with Git SCM. Double-check the noted installation directory from step 1.

```shell
npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```

4. [Install Ruby+Devkit](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) - the recommended version is [2.7.6](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.7.6-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.7.6-1-x64.exe).

- On the last stage of the installation wizard, [rdk install should be checked](https://replayable.io/replay/6301cfb5c9b98e006759ec55/?share=lNypRQvCQBmwcOu8GFpdYQ) by default. Hit enter when prompted and don't specify which component to install.

5. Install bundler and jekyll gems.

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

- Check if Jekyll has been installed properly by entering `jekyll -v` in [your terminal](https://replayable.io/replay/6301d641c9b98e006759ec56/?share=Krqcj3vLWFSosyUgHzA4vA).


6. Enter the project directory and install project gem dependencies via bundler.

```shell
bundle install
```

7. Install npm packages.

```shell
npm install
```

8. Finally, launch the app.

```shell
npm run start
```

- Enter `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and [everything should work](https://replayable.io/replay/6301e1e414ebd00066b58470/?share=dBEQn0RalVkM16fxamUw)!

## Building locally

If you want to build locally, then execute `npm run start-plugins` to start up the application stack versus `npm run start`. That way any change in the `/src` directory will build the application and refresh the page. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) if you want to configure the web server.

Running `npm run build` will [generate a local folder](https://replayable.io/replay/6301ea446a92ca00686c2470/?share=8BoFw4QCovXc4fFaY68v0w) called demo so you can run the app independently.
